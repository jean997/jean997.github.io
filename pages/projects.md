</a> <b><a name="FRET"></a>Flexible Robust Excursion Test (FRET)</b>: Is a method for testing associations with genomic phenotypes. We adaptively learn boundaries of associated regions AND control the false discovery rate. Check back soon for a pre-print. Work in progress. Get in touch if you're interested.

</a> <b><a name="JADE"></a>Joint Adaptive Differential Estimation (JADE)</b>: More of a graphical/descriptive approach to the same problem.
