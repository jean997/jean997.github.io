 I am a postdoc in the <a href="http://www.genes.uchicago.edu">Department of 
	Human Genetics</a>
   	at <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">the University of Chicago</a>,
 	co-mentored by <a href="http://xinhelab.org">Xin He</a> and
	<a href="http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu">Matthew Stephens</a>.
   I recieved my Ph.D. in 2016 in Biostatistics from the <a href="https://www.biostat.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>
  	advised by <a href="http://www.faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/">Noah Simon</a>.
 <br>
  <br> I develop statistical methods motivated by problems in genetics and genomics. Many of my current projects focus is on using genetic associations to understand causal and non-causal relationships between clinical traits (symptoms, diseases, etc), biomarkers, and -omic traits (like gene expression).  I am also interested in association testing for spatially structured data types, and more broadly, in robust and non-parametric statistical methods.
