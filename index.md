  I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/">Department of Biostatistics</a> at the University of Michigan. Previously, I did a postdoc 
 	co-mentored by <a href="http://xinhelab.org">Xin He</a> and <a href="http://stephenslab.uchicago.edu">Matthew Stephens</a>.
  in the <a href="http://www.genes.uchicago.edu">Department of 
	Human Genetics</a> at the University of Chicago.
   I received my Ph.D. in 2016 in Biostatistics from the <a href="https://www.biostat.washington.edu">University of Washington</a>
  	advised by <a href="http://www.faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/">Noah Simon</a>.
 <br>
   <br> I develop statistical methods motivated by problems in genetics and genomics. Currently, my research focuses on understanding patterns of pleiotropy (genetic sharing) across large numbers of traits. 
  This project came about as a less parametric, higher dimensional outgrowth of my interest in Mendelian randomization (see Projects page for more). Methodologically, I am interested in empirical and variational Bayes, causal inference, and robust/non-parameteric approaches. Recently, I've been thinking and learning about neural networks and methods that can be distributed across many computing systems.
